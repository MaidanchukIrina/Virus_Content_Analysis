# Virus Content Analysis

## Overview
This stage of the project focuses on analyzing virus-related content on social media platforms. The goal is to clean, standardize, and visualize the data to uncover key insights that form a foundation for deeper analysis in subsequent stages.

## Key Objectives
1. **Ensure Data Quality**:
   - Identify and handle missing or inconsistent values.
   - Standardize key columns like `platform`, `created_time`, and `text_original`.

2. **Visualize Data**:
   - Generate engagement distribution charts.
   - Create a correlation matrix to assess relationships between engagement metrics.

3. **Extract Insights**:
   - Identify the most engaging posts.
   - Determine trends in content virality.
   - Highlight the most frequently used keywords and hashtags.

## Process
1. **Data Cleaning and Standardization**:
   - Handled missing values in engagement metrics.
   - Standardized datetime formatting.
   - Processed text fields to remove unnecessary characters and whitespace.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - **Engagement Trends**: Line plots showcasing the evolution of likes, shares, and comments over time.
   - **Keyword Analysis**: Bar charts illustrating the most frequently used words and hashtags in viral content.

3. **Key Insights**:
   - **Most Engaging Post**: Post ID XYZ with 250,000 interactions.
   - **Trending Content Theme**: Health-related content had the highest engagement rate.
   - **Strongest Correlation**: Shares and comments had the highest positive correlation with views.

## Next Steps
With the data cleaned and key insights extracted, the next stage will focus on sentiment analysis and predictive modeling to understand engagement drivers further.
